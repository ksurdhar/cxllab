contact, genre/preferences, bootstrap

SECONDARY TODOS

setting up figaro
heroku

preventing users from navigating to other users pages
dry out like/dislike code (it repeats itself)
get or fetch methods for everything - speed
graphs



creating a custom scope (User.all <= all is a scope)
current_user.potential_matches
potential_matches = users with ids that are not included in my liked users



everything on your account; your email address, your username, your genre, whether or not you're a producer

matches
could use a modal, could use a subview
