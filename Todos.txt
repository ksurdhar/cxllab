LOOK AT ME HERE
My relationship controller / route is fucked up
users have all all their relationships.
      

TODO
matches, genre, swiping, graphs
add a form in account page to set genre

dry out like/dislike code
making matches persist => global collection of relationships?


creating a custom scope (User.all <= all is a scope)
current_user.potential_matches
potential_matches = users with ids that are not included in my liked users

SET UP FIGARO
