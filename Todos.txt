Algorithm for feed discovery, random, but adding a tally to # of views a profile has
Create several soundcloud accounts - say 4 per genre. 
As a person who is signed in, how do I show a track of another user?
On the feed/ discovery page, have three(or one, tinder style) javascript widgets

GOAL FOR TONIGHT: SAVE A USER WITH A SOUNDCLOUD ID

seems like we need to save the soundcloud user_id as part of the user model
look at below for how to do that. 
before save, user.sc_id = client.id


# initializing a client with an access token
client = SoundCloud.new(:access_token => SOME_ACCESS_TOKEN)

# updating the users profile description
client.put("/me", :user => {:description => "a new description"})









set up figaro
create user model with access_token, about, and genre








1. click signup => user controller uses "link or connect" action which uses the following

require 'soundcloud'

# create client object with app credentials
client = Soundcloud.new(:client_id => 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
                        :client_secret => 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
                        :redirect_uri => 'REDIRECT_URL')

# redirect user to authorize URL
redirect_to client.authorize_url()


2. redirect url matches the actual "create new user" action in the user controller

require 'soundcloud'

# create client object with app credentials
client = Soundcloud.new(:client_id => 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
                        :client_secret => 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
                        :redirect_uri => 'REDIRECT_URL')

# exchange authorization code for access token
code = params[:code]
access_token = client.exchange_token(:code => code)


3. save the access token along with the new user
