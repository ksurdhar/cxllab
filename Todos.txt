//where my.relationships.(where liked: true).liked_user_ids = users with those ids if that_model.relationships.include a liked_user_id == global
      

TODO
matches, genre, swiping, graphs
add a form in account page to set genre

dry out like/dislike code
making matches persist => global collection of relationships?


creating a custom scope (User.all <= all is a scope)
current_user.potential_matches
potential_matches = users with ids that are not included in my liked users

SET UP FIGARO

_______________________________________

create a relationships index route
make two queries

list where { liker_id: me, like: true }
get these ids
for each of these people, look through their relationships

if they have 

where { liked_user_id: me, like:true }

create a match
