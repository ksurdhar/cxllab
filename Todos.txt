create user model with access_token, about, and genre




1. click signup => user controller uses "link or connect" action which uses the following

require 'soundcloud'

# create client object with app credentials
client = Soundcloud.new(:client_id => 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
                        :client_secret => 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
                        :redirect_uri => 'REDIRECT_URL')

# redirect user to authorize URL
redirect_to client.authorize_url()


2. redirect url matches the actual "create new user" action in the user controller

require 'soundcloud'

# create client object with app credentials
client = Soundcloud.new(:client_id => 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
                        :client_secret => 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
                        :redirect_uri => 'REDIRECT_URL')

# exchange authorization code for access token
code = params[:code]
access_token = client.exchange_token(:code => code)


3. save the access token along with the new user
